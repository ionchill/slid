Second Life Inventory Downloader

## Overview
This project is intended to use the [Linden Lab Official Inventory API][LLOIAPI] to download and save an owned inventory of scripts in Second Life for backup and preservation. (They are part of my life's work, you know?) If it's helpful to you, too, then all the better. :P
